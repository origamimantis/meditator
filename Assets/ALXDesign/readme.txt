Snow generator 9
These are 64 magical multi-colored snowflakes falling from a dark moving cloud and lying on the ground. It is magically fabulous.

Additionally:
1. Prefab "Cloud" - a system of particles of realistic clouds;
2. You get 10 prefabs info billboards with varying textures.
To replace information on billboards, it is enough to replace the textures used in billboards with your own.

For use:
Just add prefabs to your project and adjust their sizes. It is also possible to add a prefab with snow to the character.

Barrels and crates are used to show tornadoes.
Trees in the Trees folder are used exclusively to demonstrate the tornado prefab.
Accompaniment soundtracks in the scene created by me can be used to show in your assets.
